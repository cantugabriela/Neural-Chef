‘Neural Chef’ – Our team is very much into good food and home cooking, so coming up with some idea along those lines was very appetizing for us. Ultimately it dawned on us: What can be more appealing and tempting than ‘Delectable Recipes’ which we can make at the comfort of our home with the ingredients we have on hands!! For any recipe to be tantalizing, the basic ingredients is ‘Veggies’. We thought what if we create an internet application, wherein the user can upload images of their desired produce and can get appropriate healthy and delicious recipe recommendations in return. This is how the app NeuralChef came to being.

If you are having unexpected guests over or running out of ideas and looking for a perfect recipe for dinner tonight or simply wondering what to do with all those veggies just sitting around in your refrigerator, this app gives you the perfect solution. The app allows for easy recipe search also featuring a filter option for cuisine-based recipes. You will now be able to cook from your phone or computer with ease. Think of this app as your personal Recipe Book.

INSTRUCTIONS- HOW TO USE THE APP:

Upload the Images of the ingredients
Select the desired cusine and search for any recipe by clicking SHOW RECIPES button
